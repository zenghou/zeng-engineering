title: About Me
---

My name is Zeng and I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Rivian. I am starting this blog because I want to share some of the interesting lessons and takeaways that I have learnt on the job. I believe starting a blog is useful for 3 reasons:

1. Writing helps me learn deeply
2. Documentation for my future self
3. Showcase my learnings

These views and opinions are strictly of my own and not representative of the organization that I work for. In addition, I will not discuss any proprietary or sensitive information related to my organization.

## Topics

I am a full-stack engineer but my current interest in building scalable back-end microservices. These are some of the topics that I will discuss about:

- Java & SpringBoot
- AWS Resources
- System Design
- GraphQL
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD
- Microservices
