description: Introductory post about this blog and what I intend to share
---

My name is Zeng and I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Rivian. I am starting this blog because I want to share some of the interesting lessons and takeaways that I have learnt on the job. I believe starting a blog is useful for 2 reasons:

1. Explaining helps me learn deeply
2. This blog is also my future portfolio

While I will be talking about some of the work at my current company, Rivian, these views and opinions are strictly of my own and not representative of the organization. In addition, I will not discuss any proprietary or sensitive information related to my organization.

## Topics

I am a full-stack engineer but my current role is backend-intensive, and the topics that I will discuss will lean heavily towards the following topics:

- Java & SpringBoot
- AWS Resources
- Design
  - System Architecture
  - Coding Patterns
- GraphQL
- DevOps
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - CI/CD
- Maintenance
